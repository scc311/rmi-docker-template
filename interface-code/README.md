# Shared Code

This is the place to put your shared code. This will at least include your interface code and the Docker Utility file.

### Docker Utility üê≥

This allows you to check if the code is running within a Docker container and get the `REGISTRY_HOST` env var if it is. Otherwise this function will return `localhost`.
